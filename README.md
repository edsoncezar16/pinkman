# Pinkman

This project aims to use arXiv data to deploy a data app that:

- Provides a visualization of topics in arXiv over time;

- Lets you talk to Pinkman, your personal research assistant, which will help you find relevant arXiv info for you faster and more engaging than by traditional means.

## How to use this project

TBD.

## Acknowledgements
